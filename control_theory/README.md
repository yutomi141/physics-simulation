# Control and Estimation Theory

This directory focuses on state estimation and stochastic control.

## 1. Bayesian Estimation
General recursive Bayesian update for a constant value. 
As shown in the figure, the uncertainty ($\tau$) decreases as /n$.

## 2. Kalman Filter
Extension of Bayesian estimation to dynamical systems.
The filter balances the system model and noisy observations via the Kalman Gain.
